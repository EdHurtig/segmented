# Segmented Least Squares Algorithm

This is a C++ to Python port of the Segmented Least Squares Algorithm

The original C++ code can be found in the link in the description of this repository.

This is a bunch of code hacking for a class project... DO NOT use in production

# Tests

I threw together the most hacked test harness.  Add a files named `test-#.txt` in the root of the project and populate the file in the same format as the others, constant on first line, space delimited point on the rest of the lines.

Then run `bash test` and it will run a bash script that tests to ensure that the Python implentation and the C++ implementation agree
